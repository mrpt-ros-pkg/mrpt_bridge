0.1.25 (2018-07-11)
-------------------
* Merge pull request `#3 <https://github.com/mrpt-ros-pkg/mrpt_bridge/issues/3>`_ from tuw-robotics/master
  TPose2D to geometry_msgs::Pose
* Update pose.h
* TPose2D Conversion to geometry_msgs::Pose added
* Merge pull request `#2 <https://github.com/mrpt-ros-pkg/mrpt_bridge/issues/2>`_ from clalancette/fix-deb-stretch
  Fix deb stretch
* Fix build warnings for signed/unsigned comparison.
  The width and height of the OccupancyGrid metadata are both
  uint32, so make the loop iterator type match.
  Signed-off-by: Chris Lalancette <clalancette@openrobotics.org>
* Workaround Debian stretch not properly setting up Qt dependencies.
  libpcl-dev really has a dependency on Qt5Widgets, but that
  is not expressed by the Debian Stretch packages.  We workaround
  it here by forcing the dependency in both the package.xml and
  the CMakeLists.txt
